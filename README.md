In Python there are two foundational concepts, namely variables such as objects, numbers and text which allow the user to interact with and manipulate the data; as well as controls such as conditional statemnets, loops and control statements which manage a program's flow and decision making.

This task was completed using Python in IDLE where the aim was to create a program that allows the user to access two different financial calculators namely an investment calculator and a home loan repaymemnt calculator. Firstly, the math library was imported to be used at a later stage. Code was written to produce the output demonstrated in Screenshot (28).png, allowing the user to choose what type of calculator tthey want to use where the entries are not case sensitive so for example, 'BOND', 'Bond'and 'bond' are all valid entries. If the user selects 'investment', they are to input the deposit amount, interest rate, duration of investment in years and whether the interest is simple or compounded with the formulas shown in Screenshot (29).png. The final answer is then printed. If the user selects 'bond' then the user inputs the present value of the house, the interest rate and the duration of repayment in months with the formula shown in Screenshot (30).png. The amount of money the user has to repay monthle is calculated then outputted.
